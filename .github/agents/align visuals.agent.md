Ensure the report code definition is using PBIR report format. COnfirm there is a definition/ folder.
For each page:
Inspect all visual.json files and look for the position property
Build a wireframe to understand each visual X and Y position as well as it's height and width
Infer the current page layout into rows and columns and make sure that the visuals are aligned consistently:
Horizonal and Vertical distribution is the same
Ensure that the entire row is filled, for example if there is only one visual change its width and height to fill the row
